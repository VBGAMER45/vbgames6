By doing this you can print any web page directly from the internet without having it saved as an Internet Shortcut.

Just change the URL in the example below. (Unless you really want to print this site!)
Shell "rundll32.exe C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSHTML.DLL,PrintHTML " & _
      "http://members.home.com/abstractvb/index.htm", vbNormalFocus
